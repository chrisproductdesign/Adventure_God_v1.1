# Final PR Instructions - MCP Unity Setup

## âœ… TASK COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY

All objectives from the original task have been accomplished:

### ðŸŽ¯ **Core Objectives Achieved**
- âœ… **Node MCP Shim**: Created at `tools/mcp-node/` with Express server on localhost:3000
- âœ… **Unity Editor Listener**: Implemented at `unity/Assets/Editor/McpUnityListener/` on localhost:8081
- âœ… **Smoke Tests**: All tests passed - GameObject creation working
- âœ… **Environment Detection**: macOS detected, Unity 2022.3.62f1 found and used
- âœ… **Security**: All services bound to localhost only
- âœ… **Repository Cleaned**: Unity Library files removed from git history
- âœ… **Branch Pushed**: `mcp/unity-setup-clean` successfully pushed to GitHub

## ðŸ”„ **Manual PR Creation Required**

Due to the `git filter-branch` operation that cleaned Unity Library files, the branch history was rewritten. GitHub cannot automatically create a PR because the branches have no common history.

### **Manual PR Creation Steps:**

1. **Visit GitHub**: Go to https://github.com/chrisproductdesign/Adventure_God_v1.1

2. **Create Pull Request**: 
   - Click "Compare & pull request" for the `mcp/unity-setup-clean` branch
   - Or visit: https://github.com/chrisproductdesign/Adventure_God_v1.1/pull/new/mcp/unity-setup-clean

3. **PR Title**: `feat(mcp): add node MCP shim and Unity editor listener for Cursor integration`

4. **PR Description**:
   ```markdown
   ## Summary
   Adds a localhost-only Model Context Protocol (MCP) shim with Unity Editor integration for Cursor â†” Unity prototyping.

   ## Changes
   - **Node MCP Shim** (`tools/mcp-node/`): Express server on port 3000 that forwards commands to Unity
   - **Unity Editor Listener** (`unity/Assets/Editor/McpUnityListener/`): HTTP listener on port 8081 that executes Unity commands
   - **MCP Tools Manifest**: Defines available commands (createGameObject, runPlayMode, takeScreenshot, buildProject)
   - **Smoke Test**: Verifies end-to-end functionality
   - **Documentation**: README and setup instructions

   ## Quick Start
   ```bash
   cd tools/mcp-node
   npm ci
   npm start
   # Open Unity project
   npm run test:smoke
   ```

   ## Security
   - All services bound to localhost only
   - No external network exposure
   - Unity Library files removed from git tracking

   ## Testing
   - âœ… Server health check working
   - âœ… Unity listener responding
   - âœ… GameObject creation successful
   - âœ… All smoke tests passing
   ```

## ðŸŽ‰ **Mission Accomplished**
